# Endogeneity Simulation

_The common endogeneity issues are addressed here to form a better hands-on understanding._



## 📘 Overview

This project illustrates three fundamental sources of endogeneity in econometrics using R simulations:

- **Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)**  
- **Collider Bias (CB)**  
- **Survivorship Bias (SB)**

Each concept is backed by simulation results, theoretical insights, and visualization. The aim is to build a more intuitive and practical understanding of these biases.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `simulation_1.R`: R script to reproduce all simulations and figures.
- `FamaFrench.csv`: Data used in the survivorship bias example.
